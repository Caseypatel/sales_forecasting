# sales_forecasting

## Project Overview

### Context
The Senior Management team from the retail company is seeking to optimize their sales strategy and improve their forecasting capabilities.

Their proposal is to leverage advanced quantitative methods, including Time Series Models and Causal Models, to analyze the sales data of their products and make accurate predictions about future sales trends. This will enable the company to make informed decisions about inventory management, supply chain optimization, and marketing strategies, ultimately driving business growth and revenue.

### Actions
**Time Series Analysis:** A comprehensive analysis of the sales data was conducted to identify patterns, seasonality, and anomalies, and to calculate key metrics such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation.
**Multiple Forecasting Models:** Four models (ARIMA, ES, Prophet, and LSTM) were trained on the training dataset and evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and MAPE.
**Model Selection:** The best-performing model (e.g. ARIMA) was selected based on its performance on the training dataset, with a MAE of 19.2%, and was used to generate forecasts for the test dataset.
